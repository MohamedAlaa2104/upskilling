Task: Library Management System
Problem Statement:
You are tasked with creating a Book class and a Library class to manage books in a library. The system should ensure that book details (e.g., title, author, ISBN) are encapsulated and cannot be directly accessed or modified from outside the class.

Requirements:
Encapsulation:

Use private properties to store book details (title, author, ISBN, isAvailable).

Provide public methods to interact with the book (e.g., borrow, return, check availability).

Ensure that the book details cannot be directly modified from outside the class.

Functionality:

Allow a book to be borrowed (mark it as unavailable).

Allow a book to be returned (mark it as available).

Provide a method to check if a book is available.

Add a method to display book details.

Real-Life Constraints:

The ISBN of a book should not be modifiable after the book is created.

The availability status (isAvailable) should only be updated through the borrow() and return() methods.
