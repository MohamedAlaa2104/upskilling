Problem Statement: Shopping Cart Discount Calculation
    You are building a simple shopping cart system where users can add items to their cart. Your task is to apply discounts based on the total amount of items in the cart.

Requirements:
    You have an array of products, where each product has a name and a price.
    If the total cart value exceeds 500, apply a 10% discount.
    If the total cart value is between 200 and 500, apply a 5% discount.
    If the total cart value is below 200, no discount is applied.
    Use loops and conditional statements to process the cart.
    Display:
    Each item’s name and price.
    The total before discount.
    The applied discount percentage.
    The final total after discount.


Example Input (PHP Array)

$cart = [
    ['name' => 'Laptop', 'price' => 300],
    ['name' => 'Mouse', 'price' => 50],
    ['name' => 'Keyboard', 'price' => 100],
    ['name' => 'Headphones', 'price' => 80],
];

Expected Output

Items in Cart:
    - Laptop: $300
    - Mouse: $50
    - Keyboard: $100
    - Headphones: $80

Total Before Discount: $530
Discount Applied: 10%
Final Total: $477


Guidelines for Solving:
    Use a loop to iterate through the cart array.
    Use if-else statements to check the total price and apply discounts.
    Use arithmetic operations to calculate the final total.

Extra Challenge:
    Try modifying the problem to allow different discount rules for specific products, such as:

    Electronics (Laptop, Headphones) → 15% discount
    Accessories (Mouse, Keyboard) → 5% discount
