Problem Statement
You are tasked with building a simple online shopping system in PHP using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system should allow users to:

    Browse products

    Add products to a cart

    Calculate the total price

    Place an order

Try to practice OOP principles
    Classes and Objects

    Encapsulation (private properties, getters/setters)

    Inheritance (different types of products)

    Polymorphism (method overriding)


Step 1: Define the Product Class
Requirements:
Each product has:

    name
    price
    description
    Provide methods to:
    Get product details (getDetails())
    Update price (setPrice())

Step 2: Extend Product for Different Types (Inheritance)
   Requirements:
   Create two subclasses:
   DigitalProduct (e.g., eBooks, software) – has a downloadLink.
   PhysicalProduct (e.g., books, gadgets) – has a weight (in kg).

Step 3: Create a Shopping Cart (Composition)
   Requirements:
   The cart should:
   Store an array of products.
   Calculate the total price.
   Allow adding/removing products.

Step 4: Simulate an Order (Polymorphism)
   Requirements:
   Create an Order class that:
   Takes a ShoppingCart and processes it.
   Displays order summary.


The end flow should be like:

// Create products
$ebook = new DigitalProduct("PHP for Beginners", 29.99, "Learn PHP OOP", "http://download.example.com/php-ebook");
$laptop = new PhysicalProduct("Laptop", 999.99, "16GB RAM, 512GB SSD", 2.5);

// Create a cart
$cart = new ShoppingCart();
$cart->addItem($ebook);
$cart->addItem($laptop);

// Place an order
$order = new Order($cart);
$order->checkout();
